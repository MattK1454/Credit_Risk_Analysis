# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze data regarding loan applications to explore which of six machine learning models 
will best predict a loan applicant as being high or low risk for a loan.

## Results

It will be of benefit to outline some of the terms used to evaluate these models prior to the start of the analysis.
 - Balanced accuracy score: A measure of how well the trained model did in predicitin classification outcomes already provided in the dataset. The higher the score
 the better the model at using the input features to classify the outcomes.
